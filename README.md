# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
